## What is D3?

D3 is a JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate DOM elements using data. ([You can do cool things without data as well](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298)). It uses HTML, CSS and SVG (more on SVG later...), to bring your data to life!

D3 is written in JavaScript which means you can write your own specific functions to present your data.

There are many similarities with jQuery and D3 in terms of selecting DOM elements and method chaining. It is also possible to style DOM elements using D3 in a similar way to CSS. So if you are familiar with these languages it will be easier to pick up.

## Why use D3?

#### Pro's

- **Lightweight:** the core file is only 336 KB
- **Highly customisable**
- **Community:** thanks to it being open source there is a large D3 community readily available to answer your questions
- [Large gallery for inspiration](http://d3js.org/)


#### Con's

- **Difficult to master:** if on a tight deadline, a framework with more ready-made templates could be more suitable
- **Browser Support:** No support for IE 6,7,8 and limited on 9
- **Exporting Charts:** Need extra code to export charts to PNG, JPG, SVG & PDF, whereas other framworks do not need this


## Intro to SVG's

SVG's are a Scaleable Vector Graphic which allow D3 more flexibility over typical HTML elements.

SVGs are similar to HTML elements, in that they have angle brackets and can be written in Markup.

[Here is a SVG element to play with](http://www.w3schools.com/svg/tryit.asp?filename=trysvg_circle)

## Installing

There are a few ways to get D3 running, the easiest is to insert this script tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

## Bar Graph Tutorial

Step 1) Make your index.html and d3.js files

Step 2) Insert an empty div with a class in index.html

```html
<div class="chart"></div>
```

Step 3) Insert an array of numbers you want to use as your data points

```javascript
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
```

Step 4) Select the div element you want to append to with the following D3 method

```javascript
d3.select(".chart")
  .selectAll("div")
```

Step 5) Now we need to map through the 'numbers' array to create each individual data point and append it to the div element.

*(the .enter() D3 method allows you to add elements to the DOM as opposed to .update() & .exit() which allow you to update and remove elements respectively)*

```javascript
  .data(numbers)
.enter().append("div")
```

Step 6) Now set the height and width attributes using the D3 method *.style()*

```javascript
    .style("height", "10px")
.style("width", function(d) { return d * 10 + "px"; })
```

- the 'd' in the function(d) relates to each element in the numbers array (you can call it what you want as long as it is consistent throughout the function)

Step 7) Set the text attribute to equal the data point value

```javascript
.text(function(d) { return d; });
```



Step 8) Create a style.css file (remember to link to it in the html file) and style the bar graph using standard css.

```css
.chart div {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;
  margin: 1px;
  color: white;
}
```

If you open up your files locally, your code & bar graph will look something like the below
