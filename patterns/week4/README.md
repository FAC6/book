#Week 4 Learning Outcomes

This week we're running the learning day before the workshop so you have a chance to find out a bit about the different types of databases and how they store data before we teach you how to implement one for your project this week.

We'll stop at 13:30 and 16:30 for presentations. 

Work in groups of four on one of these databases:

* Redis
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL
* LevelDB

If there's another database you're interested to learn about (e.g. graph database) feel free to suggest it to the group!

In your groups try and answer these questions:

* [ ] What are databases and why do we need them?
* [ ] What is a relational database?
* [ ] What is the difference between an SQL and NoSQL database?

For the specific database you're working on do some research about these topics:

* [ ] How does the DB store information? 
* [ ] What are the different data types that can be stored? e.g. strings, lists, hashes, sets
* [ ] What are the advantages and disadvantages of this database? e.g. speed, scalability, data structure, query performance
* [ ] What application areas is it suitable for?
* [ ] Who else is using it and what are they using it for? 
* [ ] What other databases is it similar to?


* [ ] How do you install the database? 
* [ ] How do you access the database from the command line?
* [ ] Which npm module should you use for this database?
* [ ] How do you host the database on heroku?


## Your task: Write a README summarising your research on these questions. 

## Stretch goal: present a working demo showing how to add to the database from an HTML form.
