#API Keys

API Often require a key to access them. This allows the site who owns the API to maintain some control and monitoring of their API.
This is done for:
* security
* monitoring / analytics

##Example
APIs may look different from different providers, but here is an example of what one might look like:

Depending on what you want to do with the API, you may need a different type of key. Youtube for example has two levels of API keys.

API Keys are 


##Best Practices for creating and generating keys
* It is recomened for you to use API keys if you have an API (for security and data reasons)
* Name your key descriptively
â€¢ Give each intergration (user) it's own API key, and assign labels for each key. So each key is unique. This allows you to disable a key if it has been compromised without disabling access to all of your other intergrations (users).
* In addition, you may want to segment access to different databases, for example on Nestoria.co.uk (property site) has one API for average house prices, and another API for listing searches. Again this allows you greater control of your APIs.
