# What is TDD?

##### TDD stands for _TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT_

It is a process that relies on the repetition  
 of a very short development cycle:

>First the developer writes an (initially failing)  
automated test case that defines a desired  
improvement or new function, then produces the  
minimum amount of code to pass that test, and  
finally refactors the new code to acceptable  
standards.
 



## The importance of TDD

TDD prevents apps '_breaking_' due to insufficient testing. It is one of the essential  
building blocks for becoming a well rounded developer because if you can't sufficiently  
test your code, your app will eventually break (_if it can be broken, someone will find   
a way to break it!_)

If these testing skills are neglected, it will almost certainly have substantial  
repercussions later on down the line. TDD provides a solid foundation on which to   
build your skills as a software developer (_you have to put in the time to reap the  
rewards_)

It may seem nonsensical at first to think about testing before you've provided a   
solution to the problem but only once you've considered the possible pitfalls of  
your app, will you be able to ensure that it will work. The more rigorous the testing   
(how much of your code is **_covered_**), the more confident you can be in launching   
your app.   
**_Note_**: _you rarely obtain 100% coverage so human review is also necessary_  

As we all know, time is one of the most (if not the most) valuable resource that    
a software developer has and so any way to streamline the development process is  
seen as a huge asset. Through TDD, writing these tests first could mean that you   
don't need to launch the program in a debugging environment later on (_slow â€”   
especially for larger projects_) to test if a few small things work.
