###What is a linter?

In computer programming, lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code.

The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. For example, JSLint is a static code analysis tool used in software development for checking if JavaScript source code complies with coding rules.

###What does a Linter do?

Lint as a term can also refer more broadly to syntactic discrepancies in general. For example, modern lint checkers are often used to find code that doesn't correspond to certain style guidelines. They can also be used as simple debuggers for common errors, or hard to find errors such as heisenbugs.

Linters are provided primarily as an online tool, but there are also command-line adaptations.
