### What is an HTTP status code and what are the most common ones?

When you make a request to a server it sends back a response message. This begins with a status line: `HTTP-version status-code reason-phrase`.

The status-code is a three digit number generated by the server to reflect the outcome of the request. Below are some common status codes and their meanings.

#### 1xx Informational



#### 2xx Success



#### 3xx Redirection

##### 301 Moved Permanently

#### 4xx Client Error

##### 403 Forbidden

##### 404 Not Found

This is the status code your browser receives when you see the the default 404: page not found page.

#### 5xx Server Error
