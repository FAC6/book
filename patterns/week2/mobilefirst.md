### Mobile first design


### Progressive enhancement

#### What is it?

Progressive enhancement is about starting the design and creation of a web app by creating a feature minimal but sleek and compatible app. Once a fast and cross-compatable site has been created successive features can be built in for browsers and devices that support more modern/intensive features.

#### Why would you use it?

Instead of using progressive enhancement methodology one might begin the creation of a site by creating and designing a feature complete site that working on modern desktop browsers.

The the site could be adapted so that the less compatible features drop away for non-compatable devices/browsers.

This can be non-ideal; since the original design of the site was not aimed at old browsers/mobile creating the slimmed down version at the end of the project may result in an unimpressive / badly designed site.  

#### How would you implement it?

A basic example of building a site using progressive enhancement would be first building the HTML in the best, most expressive way possible, then styling it with cross-compatable CSS features. Once the site is looking great with this minimal design one could further style it with more modern CSS and basic JS. Near the end of the project you would be adding the most advanced JS features. This way your project has a solid cross-compatable foundation and extends itself to use more modern features on better browsers.
