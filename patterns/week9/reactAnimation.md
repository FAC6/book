#Animation with React

The React add-ons are a collection of useful utility modules for building React apps. These should be considered experimental and tend to change more often than the core.

React provides a ReactTransitionGroup add-on component as a low-level API for animation, and a ReactCSSTransitionGroup for easily implementing basic CSS animations and transitions.

The [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) provides examples of how to animate divs so that they enter and leave the page. You can paste the examples into the [basic React template](https://github.com/jrans/React-Webpack-Set-Up) by [Jack Rans](https://github.com/jrans).

When a new item is added to a ReactCSSTransitionGroup it receives CSS classes to initiate an enter transition, and when it leaves the DOM it receives the corresponding classes to trigger a leaving transition.
