#Forking a project

A fork is copy of a repository. We fork repositories as it allows us to change and edit the code, without out changing the original project.

##Reasons why you may want to fork include:
### To propose changes to a project (or bug fixes)
Fork a repo and make your changes to fix a buy or improve performance. If they original repo owner likes your work they may merge your work back in to the original repo.

### To use someone else’s idea’s as the basis for your project
Building on someone’s existing work is great war to make better more reliable software. Using solutions that have already been solved, saves you from re-inventing the wheel.
Many repos on Github include a licence file, which will tell you how the code can be used.
