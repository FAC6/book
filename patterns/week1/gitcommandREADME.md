## Introduction

Purpose of this readme is to introduce some core concepts of Git on the command line and provide a glossary of commands and their usage.

Structure: Concept 
Command
Explanation

### *Repository (repo)*

####Concept

Simply put, this is your project folder. This repository can be located locally (in your file system on your computer), or remotely (on Github). Either way, it is the same repository.

####Commands

Clone
Fork
Pull

### *Commit*

####Concept

A way of saving your code at different points along the project. Unlike many tools you may have used however, all commits are saved. This creates a project history and a way to track changes.

####Commands

Add
commit
Push


### *Branches*

####Concept

As you work on a git repo the first branch you are on is usually the default branch. This is often called `master`. If you start working on a section of the website (say the footer styling), it is best practise to create your own branch for that feature. Creating your own branch is like taking a copy of `master` and renaming it. When you commit, they will now be on that new branch only.


####Commands

branch
checkout
merge
