##Wireframing

###What is it?

A _website wireframe_, also known as a _page schematic_ or _screen blueprint_, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.

The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together.

Usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main **focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content**.

####In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like.

> Wireframes focus on:

> * The range of functions available
> * The relative priorities of the information and functions
> * The rules for displaying certain kinds of information
> * The effect of different scenarios on the display

###Why is it important?

Wireframing is an important step in any screen design process. It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.
Wireframe is also very useful in determining how the user interacts with the interface.

####Wireframing is important because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colors, typeface choices or even copy.

###How to do it effectively?

* Try to think about the problems you’re trying to solve and the flow between the screens in your app or website.
* Use content placeholders to keep it high level
* Challenge yourself to come up with at least three different concepts for each major part of your app before moving on
* Once you’ve iterated and feel reasonably good about your design, try linking the screens together and generating a simple click-through PDF prototype.
* You can enhance the wireframes value by adding annotations
