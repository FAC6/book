###CSS positioning :

 ##Fixed, absolute and relative positioning

 fixed|absolute|relative are the possible values for the property `position` in CSS (as well as static).

  ###Fixed

  An element with the position set to `fixed` will be positioned relative to the browser window and will always stay visible on the page even after scrolling on the page.

  ###Absolute

  An element with the position set to `absolute` will be positioned either the closest to his parent's position (if the element
  is a child) or relative to the document body. It allow us to move the element anyplace on the page.

  ###Relative

  An element with the position set to `relative` will be positioned relative to its normal position. So moving the element (to the
  top, right, bottom or left) will change its position from its normal position.
