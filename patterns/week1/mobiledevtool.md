When this is turned on your window will pretend to be any of the devices you
select. This is useful as it's unlikely you'll own one of every device that you
need to test your site or app on.

Some of the preset features of the device the emulator mimics are:
- Device Screen Resolution
- Device Pixel Ratio  - *which means you can test media queries*
- The viewport - *this zooms out the page to the default of the device*
- Text auto-sizing - *something called Font Boosting that happens when you view a desktop site on a mobile.
It apparently zooms the text to make it legible but this can mess up your carefully styled site.*

## Doesn't it look cool! Thanks Google.

You can also slow change the network speed where it says Network under the blue bar at the top of the screenshot above.

This means you can test how fast your page loads if the internet isn't as top quality as ours is here at FAC.
