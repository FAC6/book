# Week 1: Learning outcomes

Open this page [in GitHub](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/book/edit/FAC6/patterns/week1/README.md).

Each of the four topics below are assigned to a jigsaw group. Each jigsaw group should produce a single readme.

Within your jigsaw groups divide the topics as you see fit. When you have finished, mark it off the list (by adding an `X` inside the `[ ]` (Commit directly to master by editing on github)) then go and review somebody else's completed topic and raise issues.

Then pick another topic.

You are also welcome to add topics.
