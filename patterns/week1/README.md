# Week 1: Learning outcomes

Open this page [in GitHub](https://github.com/FAC6/book/blob/master/patterns/week1/README.md).

Find a pair, pick a topic, mark it off the list (by adding an `X` inside the `[ ]` ), create a README and start researching. When you have finished, go and review somebody else's completed topic and raise issues.

Then pick another topic.
