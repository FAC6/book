#**What is Markdown?**

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or _italic_, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. Itâ€™s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.

####**Using different versions of Markdown**

Most websites using Markdown use standardised conventions to change the appearance of the text but many will have extended functionality that is particular to their site. Some useful 'flavours' of Markdown worth getting familiar with are [Github's][git] and [Stackoverflow's][stack].
