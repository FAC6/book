###Wireframing
(what is it, why is it important and how to do it effectively?)

A _website wireframe_, also known as a _page schematic_ or _screen blueprint_, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.

The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the websiteâ€™s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together.

Usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main **focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content**.

####In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like.

> Wireframes focus on:

> * The range of functions available
> * The relative priorities of the information and functions
> * The rules for displaying certain kinds of information
> * The effect of different scenarios on the display
