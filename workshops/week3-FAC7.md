# Workshop API requests 

## Introduction 

The aim of this workshop is to give students an understanding of how to query API's by making AJAX requests. This technique allows the user to exchange data with third party servers, allowing parts of the page to update without having to reload the entire page. 

Using XHR allows us to specify an endpoint to query API's to send back data from databases that can be receieved on the front end and processed as we wish. 

### Objectives

- Build a reputation builder app using **StackExchange API**. 
- You will make an asynchronous request from the Front End in **vanilla javascript**, to query the API.
- Given an inputed topic, you will get back the latest questions to be submited by Stack Overflow Users. 
- You will then manipulate the data recieved and display this client side. 
- Each displayed question will have a **link** to it's question, the question **title**, **time and date** of when question was asked , and how many **reputation points** the user has.
- To allow a user to answer begginers questions quickly so that a user can increase their reputation points on Stack Overflow. 


## Step 1 
- Research the Stack Exchange API find the endpoint that you require to get back the desired response. (can use POSTMAN to assist you). 

## Step 2 
- Fork the following Repo and inspect the files - if you don't understand any of the code please google it. [Reputation Builder](https://github.com/tormod17/Reputation-Builder)

## Step 3
