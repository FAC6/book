#Workshop task

For the first half of the day 2, groups will build a very simple portal through which a client with a github account could post issues to a github repo in your group's organisation. The idea is to combine information researched on day 1 to make a very simple tool that clients could use to make comments on a project without having to look at, or access, the main git repo.

Core Features:
 - A text entry area for the issue
 - A text area for the username
 - A text area for the password (protected)
 - A button that when clicked makes an authenticated post request to the Issues API and raises the issue on the repo
 
Extensions:
 - A login prompt prior to accessing the page (replacing text areas for username and password)
 - Associate labels with an issue
 - Experiment with trying to post issues with pictures (this is a stretch goal!)
 - Could you display the latest commit in a way the client understands when they log in?
 - Could you display the number of recent commits, or a timeline?
 - What about displaying the number of issues that the client has opened that remain open?
 
##Team Discussion before Week 7 Project

Project management is more than tools. Two key things to keep in mind are _processes_ and _purposes_. A simple tool that makes a vital process more efficient is more valuable that a fancy tool that is little help to a team aiming to achieve a given goal. 

In the initial period of your research, therefore, you should look at your team's working processes - what would you find useful? Does your team need ways to communicate in a standardised format? Do you need something that can ensure everyone is up to date with the progress of a project without having to hold a meeting? Take a look at the tools that you currently use - do you use the full scope of project management platforms, or do you use a tiny slice of its functionality? What don't you use, and why? If you are using one function of a full platform, would there be a way to replicate that functionality using github, or a standalone platform that you control? 

A second important consideration is the interaction of your team with clients. Take time to evaluate any experiences of this so far, and also to google client management horror stories. Clients come in all shapes and sizes. Some are clueless individuals, others may have equal to, or greater technical knowledge to your team. How can you engage disinterested clients with the working of your project, how can you manage micromanaging clients? One thing to keep in mind with client management is that clients may not want to use the tools or platforms that you currently use, or may be confused by them. Giving clients a way of interacting with your team in a way that maximises the effectiveness of their input could be a good avenue for your project.

##Exercise

Take a look at [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) and try and think about the following:
 - Do you use Pivotal Tracker?
  - If yes, what do you use it for?
  - If not, why not?
 - How could you link tasks on Pivotal Tracker to a github repo?
  - Is it possible to automate this?
 - Read up on some feedback from different organisations using PT, what are the diferences?

 - Does your experience with Pivotal Tracker mirror or differ from these experiences, if so, why do you think that is?
