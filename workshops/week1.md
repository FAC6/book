+ Introduction

  This workshop is designed to fit a shorter length than a normal workshop, since it will take place on the first day, and roughly 2 hours will be taken up with meeting everyone. The aim of the workshop is to give students experience and understanding in using Github to build static web pages, as well as using CSS and .js files as separate resources for a static form.

  Students will gain some experience using CSS to alter the appearance of elements on the page. In addition, they will replicate jQuery functions with vanilla javascript which will help them to understand how both javascript and jQuery manipulate DOM elements.
