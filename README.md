# FAC6

This is a reference for FAC6 at Founders & Coders. It is the seventh course we have run since Dan ran *Coding the web* in January 2014 and the third course at our new home in Bethnal Green.

For your open ended questions during the course, please raise them as issues on [this repo](https://github.com/FAC6/facfaq).
