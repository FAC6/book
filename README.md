# The Founders & Coders course book

When using this reference for a new course, create a new branch, if you have write permissions, or fork it, if you don't. 

Don't use the master branch for course-specific information (it is currently FAC6-specific, but this will be addressed in due course).

(This repo is the one that was originally at FAC6/book).
