# About Founders & Coders

We are a social enterprise and a freelance co-operative. 

We believe in the idea of creating environments where people can both learn and work.

This space is a realisation of that idea. 

When the company starts making a surplus, we will use that surplus to develop more study programmes and to develop new places of study and work.

That's it.
