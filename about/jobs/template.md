# Template for your LinkedIn

We want to be promote ourselves and FAC as _much_ as we can on our LinkedIn profiles and encourage people to contact us whether it be to source candidates for vacancies or freelance work.

This way, we'll _all_ have _many_ choices for what to do when we're in a position to go into a full-time job or work on freelance projects.

First step is sorting out our profiles. If you haven't got a LinkedIn, [get one](https://www.linkedin.com/start/join)!   

Then get a profile picture where you can see your face! See Josh below:

![Josh](https://files.gitter.im/hdrdavies/zUA6/rsz_josh.png)

This makes you **so** much more approachable. Nelson took a load of piccies of us which you can use if you can't source a suitable headshot. See tips [here](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2014/12/5-tips-for-picking-the-right-linkedin-profile-picture)

Profile template to follow:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdrdavies

1. Call yourself a 'Full Stack Javascript Developer' in the title. (Recruiters really don't spend a lot of time looking at a profile and often *just* look at the title). A full stack developer sounds a lot more appealing to a recruiter than a 'Trainee', or a 'Web Developer in Training'  (unfortunately)

2. Make sure your area of work is appropriate: 'Information Technology and Services' like Josh above, or 'Internet' etc.

3. Complete any other relevant information in your profile, such as **location**, **education** and **work experience** (emphasise *anything* which is tech based, and consider saying *less* about anything which isn't). You can also say how great you are with prizes you've won and languages you speak, but this doesn't get looked at as much as the top of your profile. Add skills for your buddies to endorse, but these *often* get overlooked too

4. In your summary, put the following:

 >I'm currently on a full-time immersive web development course at the highly competitive Founders & Coders academy in Bethnal Green. By the end of the course I will be equipped with tools to build full-stack projects.

 >We have a number of developers at Founders and Coders who are open to being contacted about vacancies or contracting opportunities. You can email us here:

 >hireus@foundersandcoders.com

 >We are also open to hearing about projects you may be interested in being built. Get in touch on the same e-mail for any web development work you need. We'd love to hear from you!

 Also link to your GitHub profile in your summary! (press the **link** button when you're editing your profile)

5. In the Founders and Coders section of your experience, add the following:

  >A four month intensive web development bootcamp, covering the following and more:

 >-HTML, CSS & Javascript   
 >-Git and GitHub  
 >-Node.js  
 >-Agile and Test-Driven Development   

 Then add a link to the website as well as a link to the Guardian article or any other of the number of articles FAC has featured in. Spread the word!

6. Respond to recruiters. We _really_ want to make sure we all have a number of opportunities to look at if any of us consider leaving FAC for a full-time job. It is important, therefore, for FAC to forge a number of direct and sustainable relationships with the appropriate companies. This can be achieved quicker and in greater numbers if we all respond to direct contact we get. Please see the __template message__ below

7. Don't put your personal email or number on your profile

##### Quick note on recruiters

You will be contacted either by an internal recruiter :smile: or an external recruiter :unamused: (which I used to be):

* __Internal recruiter__ - the ones we're most interested in. They work for the company where the vacancy is and therefore *normally* have the interests of the company at heart, and will be in contact with the hiring managers __far more often__ than the external recruiter will be. Why make the process slower by including a middle man? They will also be _far_ more likely to understand the culture of the company as well as understand how _well_ any of us fit the opportunity

* __External recruiter__ - they're tricky. They work almost *entirely* on commission so _all_ they want to do is find someone who can pass an interview, get a job and work long enough for them to claim the recruitment fee. We *may* be interested in them if they can split a recruitment fee but this is not *particularly* likely. You could try speaking with them to find out the name of the company they are working with and then we can get in direct contact. This really **isn't** the most noble thing to do, but our cause is noble in sustaining the FAC community and academy (do you think the recruiter will be doing the same thing with his or her fee?)

Any other questions on recruiters please do ask Huw (hdrdavies) on Gitter (or if you need a hand with your LinkedIn).

#### Template message

Quick note again: recruiters are the kings of __copy & paste__ messages, so they'll *likely* spot if you're doing it. If possible, edit the template so it doesn't look _super_ generic.

> Hi [**their name here**]!

> Thanks for getting in touch with me, this looks really interesting. As mentioned in my summary, I have a number of colleagues who could well be interested in this job, so we have a shared portal for any opportunities at this inbox:

> hireus@foundersandcoders.com

> We all consider each opportunity and put the person who is best suited forward. Therefore, if you could send more details or a job description [**if they haven't attached one**] to the email address above or alternatively give us a call on +44 20 3583 2442. I look forward to hearing from you again and keeping in touch.

> Best regards,  
> [**You**]

It sounds like a silly thing to note, but **please** remember to take the square brackets out of the message - I've forgotten to do this many times in my time as a **serial** copy-paster, so don't make the mistakes I have done!

We are forwarding jobs to this email address so we all have a chance to consider each opportunity and discuss who would most like to / be most suited to go for the opportunity. Additionally, having Dan, Ines and Nelson among others cast a critical eye over a job opportunity will be **invaluable** for us. I'm sure you'll agree that as FAC students we don't know _too_ much about the job market at current!

Hope you **do** get bombarded by recruiters!
