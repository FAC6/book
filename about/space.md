# The space

The space here is shared between the current cohort, graduates of previous cohorts, Dan and *dwyl*.

***dwyl*** is run by Nelson and Ines. Nelson is our lead technical mentor and Ines is director of Founders & Coders. *dwyl* is an agency that employs some of our graduates on a freelance basis. You will hear more about *dwyl* in due course.
