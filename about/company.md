# About Founders & Coders

We are a social enterprise and a freelance co-operative.

According to documents lodged at *Companies House*, are activities are:

    Providing programmes of study for the general public.

    Providing a place of learning and work for our members.

And,

    If the company makes any surplus it will be used for developing further 
    programmes of study and for developing further places of study and work.

What this means in practice is that we are aiming to create an environment capable of offering the best possible training in software development at the lowest possible cost.
