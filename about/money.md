# How do we support ourselves?

Because all graduates of the programme who remain in the space are working freelance, the two big costs are (or should be) rent and Dan's remuneration. We are now covering our rent, but Dan is not yet drawing a salary.

The two main sources of income right now are:

* Money received from employers for hiring our graduates;

* A proportion of the income of graduates who are freelancing in the space.

Graduates have no contractual obligation to be hired or to freelance through us, but if you want to find employment, please let us help you find work before you start looking yourself. If you see a job you like the look of, please let us contact the employer on your behalf.
