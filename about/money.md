# How do we support ourselves?

Our main sources of income are:
+ a proportion (10%) of the income of graduates who are freelancing in the space;
+ fees received from employers for hiring our graduates.

We have two main costs: rent and Dan's salary.

After one year of operation, we are not yet breaking even, but we intend to by the end of this year.
