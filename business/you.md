# Developing your personal profile

Regardless of whether you are looking for a job or wanting to work freelance, you will make your life easier if you have a visible oinline presence.

Here is a checklist:
+ Have a great Github profile, see e.g. see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/nelsonic)
+ Have a great profile on Linkedin; 
+ Have a great CV, see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/Neats29/CV)
+ Have a great personal website, see e.g. [this one](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/)
+ Follow and endorse each other on Github, Linkedin and Twitter
+ Contribute to open source projects on Github (we will be developing some later in the course)
+ Contribute to open source learning materials on Github (like ours!)
