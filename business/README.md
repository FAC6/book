# Business development

There are three key areas to business development on this course.

## Development of your own personal profile

In particular, develop your profiles on Github (see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/nelsonic)) and on Linkedin; put together a good CV (see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/Neats29/CV)).

***Follow and endorse each other on Github, Linkedin and Twitter***.

## Job hunting

When you see a job you like, do this:

![Tweet the employer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/37059/9995677/571da2da-607b-11e5-999a-64b76a81e57f.png)

In other words, with every potential employer, ***invite them to come and talk to us about their job***.


## Finding projects for your cohort

From Week 13 onwards, we want you to work on projects for external clients. We hope to be able to find some for you, but we cannot guarantee it and you will almost certainly need to be active in trying to find potential clients for your cohort.

Go to meetups, network and ***invite potential clients to come and pitch their project to us***.
