# Business development

In the second part of this course, you will be working together on real projects for real clients.

We do not have these clients yet. It is our collective responsiblity to go and find them.

You also need to start building up your own profile as a developer. 

We will be spending time over the next 16 weeks building our presence both collectively and individually, so that work opportunities start coming in when we are ready for them in the second half of the course.
