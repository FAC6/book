# Business development

There are just two key areas to business development on this course.

## Development of your own personal profile

In particular, developing your profiles on Github (see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/nelsonic))and on Linkedin, butting together a good CV (see e.g. [this one](https://github.com/Neats29/CV))

## Finding projects for your cohort

From Week 13 onwards, we want you to work on projects for external clients. We hope to be able to find some for you, but cannot guarantee it and you will need to be active in trying to find potential clients for your cohort.
