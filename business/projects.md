# Finding projects for your cohort

From Week 13 onwards, we want you to work on projects for external clients. We hope to be able to find some for you, but we cannot guarantee it and you will need to be active in trying to find potential clients for your cohort.

Take a look at [Katerina's slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WbF49FV4mh8U1llHwwEsQ0-Mb-ipKLgLSS5r-g8R1jA/) and her [events list](https://github.com/katpas/fac-events).

Partner up with a one or two other people and pick some events to attend. Wear a FAC T-shirt and take some business cards. Your aim is to ***invite potential clients to come and pitch their project to us***.
