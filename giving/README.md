# Giving back

There are several ways we ask you to give back to the community here.

## Help with our free coding meetups and workshops

In particular, we ask you to get involved in running our [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/), while you are on the course.

## Communications

We have identified 16 communication tasks that need doing and we are going to ask you ti sign up for one of them.

## The space

Help us keep this space clean and in a good state of repair.

## Help us run the next course  

After you graduate we are very keen for you to help us deliver the next course. It's success will be very dependent on your willingness to get involved.

## Let us help you find you work

We intend to find work for everyone who wants it. Please let us help you.
