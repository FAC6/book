# Giving back

There are two main ways we ask you to give back to the community here

## Help with our freee coding meetups and workshops

In particular, we ask you to get involved in running our [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/), while you are on the course.

## Help us run the next course  

After you graduate we are very keen for you to help us deliver the next course. It's success will be very dependent on your willingness to get involved.
