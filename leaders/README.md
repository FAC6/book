# Checklist for course leaders

If this looks like too much: **delegate, delegate, delegate**. 

Just because you are leading the week, it does not mean that you have to do all the work for it. A lot of the interactions during the week are short, do not need preparation, and fun.  

Do not hesitate to plunder material from previous courses and do not take on more work that you can comfortably handle. Work in pairs or threes or even groups of four, but make sure that at least one person each day is responsible for keeping to the timetable.

## In advance
+ **Actions to take**:
  + Meet with the previous week's course leaders
  + Check [Stop, Go, Continue notes](../sgc/README.md) for any change requests
  + Tweak the [timetable](../timetable) for your week
  + Check if any [learning outcomes from previous week](../patterns) still need completing
  + Update the relevant pages on the book to reflect the new content
+ **Materials to prepare and things to organise**:
  + Weekend assignment for the previous Friday (what do students need to research for your week?)
  + All-day workshop for Monday
  + Topics for Tuesday (no more than 16 learning outcomes total)
  + Speakers and MVP pitches for Monday and Tuesday
  + Morning challenges for Tuesday and Wednesday
  + Project for Wednesday
  + Find volunteers for office hours on Wednesday and Thursday
  + Find volunteer for Friday upstairs project presentation
  + External reviewer for Friday code review

## Each day
+ Put the timetable for that day up on a whiteboard

## End of the week
+ Update [Stop, Go, Continue notes](../sgc/README.md)    
+ Review this checklist    
+ Review the course content and amend as necessary   
+ Hand-over to next week's course leaders

## Note on workshops
For the workshop day on Monday, aim to split the day up into two self-contained parts of about three hours each, which can either be two self-contained workshops or one workshop followed by a related assignment. We intend to start delivering these workshops as self-contained evening workshops for the general public.
