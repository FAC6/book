# Checklist for course leaders

If this looks like too much: delegate, delegate, delegate. Just because you are leading the week, it does not mean that you have to do all the work for it. A lot of the interactions during the week are short, do not need preparation, and fun. Do not hesitate to plunder material from previous courses and do not take on more work that you can comfortably handle. Work in pairs or threes or even groups of four, but make sure that at least one person each day is responsible for keeping to the timetable.

## To prepare in advance
+ Meet with the previous week's course leaders
+ Check [Stop, Go, Continue notes](sgc/README.md) for any change requests
+ Check the timetable for the previous week and apply any desired tweaks
+ Check state of learning outcomes from previous week to see if any still need completing
+ Weekend assignment for the previous Friday
+ All-day workshop for Monday
+ Topics for Tuesday (no more than 16 learning outcomes total)
+ Speakers and MVP pitches for Monday and Tuesday
+ Morning challenges for Tuesday and Wednesday
+ Project for Wednesday
+ Volunteers for office hours on Wednesday and Thursday
+ Volunteer for Friday upstairs project presentation
+ External reviewer for Friday code review
+ Update the relevant pages on the book to reflect the new content
