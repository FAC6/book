# Week 2 Project

## Client-side developer challenge

Your project this week is to build a simple website using **test driven development** that **queries an API** and appends that data to the DOM.

What you choose to build with this data and how you choose to display it is up to you.   
We suggest you spend:
+ 1 x 20 minute interval coming up with ideas _and_ picking the one you'll work on this week
+ 1 x 20 minute interval deciding what you _need_ to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting out the tasks 

Similar to last week, you have Wednesday and Thursday to build the majority of your project, with code reviews on Friday morning.
On Friday we'll also have final presentations in the afternoon.

Other than the code reviews from your peers, there will also be an external adjudicator from one of the APIs coming down on Friday afternoon to look at the projects.


#### APIs:
Select from these three APIs:
* Guardian
* Instagram
* Soundcloud

#### Requirements:
+ Mobile first design
+ Realtime content
+ A solid readme 

#### To keep in mind:
* Hiding confidential information. When querying APIs with API keys, keep in mind concealing the keys from prying eyes.
* Testing will not be one person's sole responsibility. Everyone on the team must write at least one test. 

#### Stretch Goals:
* Dynamic search
* Local browser user session storage
* Look into optimising the loading by queueing or incremental loading of the page
