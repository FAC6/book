# Stop, Go, Continue notes

## Immediate changes
+ **Week 4:** Everyone commits to washing their dishes _as soon as they've used them_
+ Create a *suggested workshops* issue on the FAC6/book repo and add to it  
+ From Week 8 onwards, start reviewing other teams' code on each project day, ending in a review of all three teams' projects on Friday morning  
+ Stop giving too many options (e.g. ways of doing auth) - make the cohort aware of the different ways of doing things, but whittle them down to two options  
+ FAC6-wide discussion around processes for Coding For Everyone (getting people on the Gitter channel, introductory talks, general process)


## Ongoing actions for FAC6 course
+ More lightning talks
+ Week 4 - keep booking speakers, they love them
+ Create template for readmes on Tuesdays
+ Best practice READMEs, e.g. [Node starter kit](https://github.com/sofer/sssk)  
+ Stop working when you're supposed to be reviewing people's code  
+ Start keeping the volume down during reading days - and less rowdiness in general (but mainly Monday mornings)  
+ Start - a forum for unanswered questions - FAQ repo within FAC6 to raise issues on  


## Morning challenges
+ Solutions for morning challenges must be put up on GitHub
+ Morning challenges are _solved as a class_ from scratch again rather than talking through one person's existing solution  
+ Continue - morning challenge solving other peopleâ€™s problems using github readmes


#### Mondays - now Research days (used to be workshop day)
+ 10:00 Show & Tell on cool websites and technologies the students have found
+ Provide a practical task associated with the research topics, so that you know what you're trying to achieve with the research
  + If this isn't possible, provide more directed questions so people don't spend large chunks of the day researching irrelevant information
+ Jigsaw classroom all day (this is still a hit in week 4), ~~with presentations of what is ready just after lunch~~
  + Presentations will take place **without a projector**
+ Keep structuring the research topics well, week 4 is a good example of what worked well
+ Post projects to a readme in the morning so if people want to know what it is we can do so
(++ this keeps being requested, again in week 4)


#### Tuesdays - now Workshop days (used to be Research on Learning outcomes)
+ Workshops for **half to two thirds of the day**, with the last half or couple of hours of the day dedicated to starting the project
+ **15h00:** intro the project, then create READMEs + do wireframing  
+ As part of workshop include a session on reviewing modules and discussing best practices / patterns  

#### Wednesdays & Thursdays
+ Don't write code until the README is done
+ Add mid-project code review at lunch
+ **18h00:** everyone writes on a wall what their biggest learning (or what they struggled most with) from the day was
  + People now know who to go to for help with those topics

#### Fridays
+ Definitely keep code reviews first thing in the morning
+ Continue pairing to provide feedback on that week's projects
+ Seriously, stop closing issues you haven't opened
+ Start using labels (i.e. "fixed") in your repo issues
+ Whiteboard diagram walk-throughs as a chance to ask the questions from the week

# FAC7

## Actions before FAC7
+ Changes to pre-requisites:
  + Add in some DOM manipulation stuff
  + Remove jQuery (added as homework for first weekend)
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **Git party** for FAC7
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **install party** for FAC7

## Curriculum changes for FAC7

### General
+ Make sure people know from the beginning:
  + The emphasis of projects is on _learning_, not on finishing every possible thing on the project or presenting a beautiful product
  + Everyone has to commit to wash up straight after using their dishes
+ If Pivotal Tracker is introduced (and the feeling in the room was that it wasn't a helpful tool for the task at hand) this should be done at the very beginning of the project, not on day two 
+ GitHub issues seems to work very well as a project management tool (instead of Pivotal tracker) and should be **introduced earlier in the course** (for FAC6 we introduced it on week 12 _officially_, though we talked about it throughout)
 
+ Simplify teaching of Auth  

+ Commitment was _low_ for a good portion of students in week 12. It was discussed that this was because:
  1. **Everyone needed a break** - people were tired and definitely needed time off to rest
  + A lot of people were attending to 'life admin'; things that had been piling up for the previous weeks
  + It was the week before the first set of MVPs and everyone spent a good chunk of time locking down the scope for those
  
### List of things to review every week
In week 12 it was agreed that there should be a list of things up on a wall of things that everyone should keep in mind at all times. This includes:
+ This is a _learning experience_, not a competition
+ Remember to switch driver every 30 minutes or so when pairing
+ Always take time to push your code and update the issue you're working on _before you leave_ in the evening
  + i.e. Ensure that someone else can easily pick up where you left off
+ Readme driven development - pretty much every PR should include a contribution to the readme

### Week 1
+ Have a(n external) speaker to speak about how to do pair programming _the right way_
+ Review use of Jekyll
  + _Pros:_ introduces templating and file structure
  + _Cons:_ wasted a lot of time trying to understand Jekyll-specific things that won't be useful, SCSS file confused _everyone_
  + Whatever we choose **have to ensure everyone know exactly what they're supposed to take from it before the week 1 project starts**, i.e. which bits to focus on and which to ignore (like SASS) (_FAC6 also requested this!!_)
+ Start with a simple exercise to learn Git and talk through it again as a class before we move on
  + Together create a git flow poster and **keep it up on the wall for the first week**

+ Add jQuery course to the weekend assignment for week 1 (people won't use it but must be able to recognise it)

### Week 2
+ Consider adding to week 2 learning outcomes: CORS, JSONP and callbacks
+ Definitely continue giving students 3 different APIs, they really liked comparing the use of different APIs

### Weeks 9-12
+ Introduce more practice on splitting up problems into tasks to be divided amongst a team earlier on
+ Maybe students can pitch ideas for projects to ensure everyone is working on something they enjoy
+ Working for **one** week in a team of 8 in a very valuable experience - the feeling in the room was that this would not be enjoyable for more than one week
  + These larger teams should have a scrum master (this should be enforced rather than suggested)
  + Some people became unengaged because there was less pressure to deliver _as individuals_ - keep the pressure and accountability up
