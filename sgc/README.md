# FAC7

## Actions before FAC7
+ Changes to pre-requisites:
  + Add in some DOM manipulation stuff
  + Remove jQuery (added as homework for first weekend)
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **Git party** for FAC7
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **install party** for FAC7

## Curriculum changes for FAC7

### Week 1
+ Review use of Jekyll
  + _Pros:_ introduces templating and file structure
  + _Cons:_ wasted a lot of time trying to understand Jekyll-specific things that won't be useful, SCSS file confused _everyone_
  + Whatever we choose **have to ensure everyone know exactly what they're supposed to take from it before the week 1 project starts**, i.e. which bits to focus on and which to ignore (like SASS) (_FAC6 also requested this!!_)
+ Start with a simple exercise to learn Git and talk through it again as a class before we move on
  + Together create a git flow poster and **keep it up on the wall for the first week**

+ Add jQuery course to the weekend assignment for week 1 (people won't use it but must be able to recognise it)

### Week 2
+ Consider adding to week 2 learning outcomes: CORS, JSONP and callbacks
+ Definitely continue giving students 3 different APIs, they really liked comparing the use of different APIs
