# Stop, Go, Continue notes

+ The week's project and workshop should relate to each other (e.g. if the workshop is on JWT, the project should also use JWT)
+ Provide a _suggested_ project for OAuth week (@sofer and @mantagen suggest commenting functionality for an app), but encourage people to pursue their own ideas if they have any
  + Too much freedom in a project is a bad thing 
+ Keep doing TDD in walkthroughs
+ In final presentations, talk about the week's fails and eureka moments
  + These should be kept in the readme as you go along
