# Stop, Go, Continue notes

## Immediate changes
+ **18h00:** everyone writes on a wall what their biggest learning (or what they struggled most with) from the day was
  + People now know who to go to for help with those topics

## Ongoing actions for FAC6 course
+ More lightning talks   

#### Tuesdays
+ Research days worked well in week 1, trial again in week 2
+ Provide **16 learning outcomes for Tuesdays**, split into 8 in the morning with a presentation and 8 in the afternoon 

#### Fridays
+ Continue pairing to provide feedback on that week's projects

## Actions before FAC7
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **Git party** for FAC7
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **install party** for FAC7

## Curriculum changes for FAC7

### Week 1
+ Review use of Jekyll
  + _Pros:_ introduces templating and file structure
  + _Cons:_ wasted a lot of time trying to understand Jekyll-specific things that won't be useful, SCSS file confused _everyone_
  + Whatever we choose **have to ensure everyone know exactly what they're supposed to take from it before the week 1 project starts**, i.e. which bits to focus on and which to ignore (like SASS) (_FAC6 also requested this!!_)
+ Start with a simple exercise to learn Git and talk through it again as a class before we move on
  + Together create a git flow poster and **keep it up on the wall for the first week**
