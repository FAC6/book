# Stop, Go, Continue notes

### Week 6

**STOP**    
+ Seriously, stop closing issues you haven't opened
+ Writing code until the README is done

**Go**    
+ At 3pm on Tuesday, intro the project, then create READMEs + do wireframing
+ Create a *suggested workshops* issue on the FAC6/book repo and add to it
+ Start using labels (i.e. "fixed") in your repo issues

**Continue**    
+ FAQ ime for morning challenges
+ Best practice READMEs, e.g. [Node starter kit](https://github.com/sofer/sssk)

## Immediate changes
+ **Week 4:** Everyone commits to washing their dishes _as soon as they've used them_

## Ongoing actions for FAC6 course
+ More lightning talks
+ Week 4 - keep booking speakers, they love them
+ Create template for readmes on Tuesdays

## Morning challenges
+ Solutions for morning challenges must be put up on GitHub
+ Morning challenges are _solved as a class_ from scratch again rather than talking through one person's existing solution

#### Mondays - now Research days (used to be workshop day)
+ 10:00 Show & Tell on cool websites and technologies the students have found
+ Provide a practical task associated with the research topics, so that you know what you're trying to achieve with the research
  + If this isn't possible, provide more directed questions so people don't spend large chunks of the day researching irrelevant information
+ Jigsaw classroom all day (this is still a hit in week 4), ~~with presentations of what is ready just after lunch~~
  + Presentations will take place **without a projector**
+ Keep structuring the research topics well, week 4 is a good example of what worked well
+ Post projects to a readme in the morning so if people want to know what it is we can do so
(++ this keeps being requested, again in week 4)


#### Tuesdays - now Workshop days (used to be Research on Learning outcomes)
+ Workshops for **half to two thirds of the day**, with the last half or couple of hours of the day dedicated to starting the project

#### Wednesdays & Thursdays
+ Add mid-project code review at lunch
+ **18h00:** everyone writes on a wall what their biggest learning (or what they struggled most with) from the day was
  + People now know who to go to for help with those topics

#### Fridays
+ Definitely keep code reviews first thing in the morning
+ Continue pairing to provide feedback on that week's projects
+ Whiteboard diagram walk-throughs as a chance to ask the questions from the week

# FAC7

## Actions before FAC7
+ Changes to pre-requisites:
  + Add in some DOM manipulation stuff
  + Remove jQuery (added as homework for first weekend)
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **Git party** for FAC7
+ **Agreed:** FAC6 will run a pre-course **install party** for FAC7

## Curriculum changes for FAC7

### General
+ Make sure people know from the beginning:
  + The emphasis of projects is on _learning_, not on finishing every possible thing on the project or presenting a beautiful product
  + Everyone has to commit to wash up straight after using their dishes
+ If Pivotal Tracker is introduced (and the feeling in the room was that it wasn't a helpful tool for the task at hand) this should be done at the very beginning of the project, not on day two

### Week 1
+ Review use of Jekyll
  + _Pros:_ introduces templating and file structure
  + _Cons:_ wasted a lot of time trying to understand Jekyll-specific things that won't be useful, SCSS file confused _everyone_
  + Whatever we choose **have to ensure everyone know exactly what they're supposed to take from it before the week 1 project starts**, i.e. which bits to focus on and which to ignore (like SASS) (_FAC6 also requested this!!_)
+ Start with a simple exercise to learn Git and talk through it again as a class before we move on
  + Together create a git flow poster and **keep it up on the wall for the first week**

+ Add jQuery course to the weekend assignment for week 1 (people won't use it but must be able to recognise it)

### Week 2
+ Consider adding to week 2 learning outcomes: CORS, JSONP and callbacks
+ Definitely continue giving students 3 different APIs, they really liked comparing the use of different APIs
