### week2:

* GO: Longer times for code reviews
* GO: Morning challenge/workshop other than a readme on Mondays

### week3:

* STOP: Overrunning on readme presentations. Make sure each ReadMe only takes up a certain amount of time. Any un-addressed questions to be put in a questions-readme in the FAC7 book.
* STOP: Codeacademy API Tutorial - replace with the twitter/postman tutorial on Youtube. (Note: in general, codeacademy is a little slow)
* STOP: Decrease the number of topics for the READMEs - maybe replace them with the difficult topics and replace the less necessary ones with tutorials. Possible options: maybe categorise topics into 'What is this?' and 'How do you do/use this'?
* GO: Give more direction on the APIs. Take note of the APIs that are - have a directed exercise to find specific traits of APIs that might flag up problems and what those problems are. Alternatives to API project --> Do it in Node Week? Or even provide a server (that isn't explained)
* GO: Tormod's tutorial for StackOverflow --> Liked the boilerplating and being able to get stuck into things without having to structure things...?
* GO: Possibly compile the best parts of different APIs.
* GO: Talks from external speakers
* GO: Release the next week's schedule on Fridays.
* STOP/GO: Thursdays - the entire day should be dedicated to the Projects
* GO: Really basic overviews on each topic

##### other:
* what do we look for in an mvp? Is this person plausible? Would you like to work for this person? Does the idea make sense? And do you think this idea could work? Is there funding? If there isn't what's the plan? And more importantly, what are the long term plans with this project? How can you strip this down into the base components? What can you deliver in 2 weeks (10 working days)?

#### summary of points:

(1) Possible structures for Mondays + Tuesday Mornings:
Mondays: Morning challenge/workshop/exercise --> Really brief intro into topics to be covered --> 'What is this' topics (a few in pairs?) --> Lunch --> 'How do you do/use this' topics (one per pair or team?) --> Time-structured presentations (~15mins each?).
Tuesday Mornings: Do the tutorials created by each pair on the previous day + compile a list of the best tutorials and parts of readmes from the day before.

(2) Release the schedule for the next week on the Friday before.

(3) Allocate longer times for Friday Code Reviews (~1.5 hours).

(4) For the next cohort's API week, possibly use: (1) [Postman Tutorial included in https://github.com/FAC7/READMEs/blob/master/week3/Tools/postman.md by Tall Jack (FAC7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhPb6ocUz_k) and (2) [Tormod's (FAC6) Tutorial](https://github.com/tormod17/Reputation-Builder)

(5) Note to course leaders: Have a leader from the following week join Stop, Go and Continue on the Friday before.
