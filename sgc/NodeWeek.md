## Fri 12th Feb

* GO - whiteboard walkthrough on callbacks (this was done on that afternoon)
* GO - They liked having a 4 day project for their first week of Node.
* GO - Liked the idea of having one day of coding for their project and then deleteing all the code and then beginning again using TDD.
* CONTINUE - morning challenges not on project days

## Thurs 18th Feb

* GO - suggestion of one hour of project planning and then a quick 10 minute presentation from each group to present their project idea and wireframes
* GO - communal group cooking day
* GO - business cards for events
* CONTINUE - practical days with tutorials and workshops
* FAC7 said they don't want too many 4 day projects but the 4 day project for their first week of node was a good amount of time. They said it's good to mix things up with the project time length.

### Note this was a week and a half of Node
