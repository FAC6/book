## Fri 26th Feb

### GO
 * studying anti-patterns and solutions to those anti-patterns. Suggestion: make a readme topic - 10 best patterns and anti-patterns in javascript.
 * more information on testing redis and sockets
 * More strict on timings to fit everything into the week:
    * make morning challenges shorter (only an hour max)
    * stop workshops on Monday at 4pm and then intro readmes
    * readme write up finish just after lunch and then start going through readme tutorials
    * Introduce projects earlier - end of Tuesday
 
### CONTINUE
   * group cooking. 
   * challenging projects. But maybe make projects have less scope.
