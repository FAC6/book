# Week 6: Using A Map/Chart Library and a real time api to create cool interactive map

Hey guys seems like you're on your way to becoming pretty awesome developers using Socket.io and other cool gadgetry.

You had a lot of fun with the back-end last week but now it's time to do some serious front-end developing.

Looking at data can be boring especially when your presented with some rubbish excel graphs 'ERR!'. Many web applications that you come across will involve some form of data visualisation, so it is important that you utilise the available tools to create something sick.

The aim of this project is to use a real-time api like     [Instagram](https://instagram.com/developer/realtime/) and [TFL](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs) with a cool library like leaflet/ D3 / Chart.js / Google Maps to make a  sweet and interactive web app.

## Core Aims

#### Step 1
 Create a server which interacts with the api of your choosing. Make some super simple interactions like a basic search.

 - Make sure that all handlers are extracted into a handlers folder as separate files and that all handlers are well tested.
 - Use a [node routing module
 ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/routes) or create your own and create another file called route.js where these routes are specified.


#### Step 2

  Choose a library and create a front-end that uses the data that you obtained from the api and displays it on a map or chart.


#### Step 3

 Now it's time to get creative, take a look at what data your chosen api provides and use it to create something fun and interesting.

#### Extra points
- **No for loops**
- **Aim for full coverage**
