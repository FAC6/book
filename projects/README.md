# Projects

Projects usually start each week at around midday on Wednesday and end on Friday with at-desk code reviews in the morning and whole-class end-of-project reviews in the afternoon.

Please read [these notes on code reviews](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/playbook/blob/master/code-reviews.md)

## Morning code reviews
In pairs, read and run the other teams' projects and raise issues. Read our [notes on code reviews](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/playbook/blob/master/code-reviews.md) and aim to add to your critical repertoire each week.

## End-of-project review checklist

  + Have wireframes or diagrams been included?
  + Any badges?

  + Any interesting ones?
