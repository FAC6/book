Week 2 Project
Client-side developer challenge

Your project this week is to build a simple website using test driven development that queries an API and appends that data to the DOM.

What you choose to build with this data and how you choose to display it is up to you.
We suggest you spend:

1 x 20 minute interval coming up with ideas and picking the one you'll work on this week
1 x 20 minute interval deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting out the tasks
Similar to last week, you have Wednesday and Thursday to build the majority of your project, with code reviews on Friday morning. On Friday we'll also have final presentations in the afternoon.

Work in paris to code an API per pair.

Other than the code reviews from your peers, there will also be an external reviewer coming on Friday afternoon to look at the projects.

APIs:

Select from these three APIs:
+ Do not need an API Key
TFL
IMDB

Guardian
Instagram
Soundcloud
Requirements:

Mobile first design
Realtime content
A solid readme
Keep in mind:

Hiding confidential information. When querying APIs with API keys, keep in mind concealing the keys from prying eyes.
DOM manipulation is expensive. Think of ways that you can minimise the number of DOM insertions in your code.
Don't repeat yourself. If you catch yourself repeating blocks of code with minor variations: stop it and refactor.
Everyone on the team must write at least one test.
Stretch Goals:

Dynamic search
Local browser user session storage
Look into optimising the loading by queueing or incremental loading of the page
