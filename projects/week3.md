# Week 3 Project

## Autocomplete

DWYL has a rather excellent tutorial for this project [here](https://github.com/dwyl/autocomplete), which is what you'll be following this week.

The idea is that you will use a dictionary API to get the definition for a word *as it is typed* - cool, right? Oh, and it also has to be done TDD!

In your teams, split into two pairs; one pair will work on the back-end (querying the API, and testing the server), and the other pair will work on the front-end (don't forget about QUnit and repo badges!).

### NOTE
We recommend using the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/), instead of the recommended Wiktionary, as it returns the data in a much easier to manage object, leaving you time to do other cool stuff!


#### Don't Forget
+ This project must be done TDD
+ **TDD**
+ Repo badges
+ >80% coverage
+ Deploy to Heroku


#### Stretch Goals
+ Try incorporating another API into your project, maybe Twitter
+ Have a look at [Simple Writer](http://xkcd.com/simplewriter/) for inspiration - it checks if your typed word is one of the 1,000 most common words in the English language
