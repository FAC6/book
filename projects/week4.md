# Week 4 Project

## Twitter

This week, you're going to build Twitter. I'm tempted to leave it there, but I guess a little bit of guidance might be helpful.

You probably know how Twitter works already, but the aim is to allow people to write tweets that are all displayed on the page in **real time** (*gasp*). As you might have guessed from the tasks this week, you'll be using a database - exciting.

### Step 1
+ Make Create, Read and Delete (CR-D) endpoints

### Step 2
+ Store tweets in Redis

### Step 3
+ Use cookies to restrict tweet deletion to the browser from which the tweet was originally created (we don't want any nefarious individuals deleting other people's tweets)

### Step 4
+ Deploy to Heroku

### Step 5
+ Add real-time updates of tweets using *front-end JavaScript*

### Stretch goal
+ Implement real-time updates using *Socket.IO* instead


#### Don't forget
+ We expect to see testing on both the front-end and back-end
+ >80% coverage
+ A full suite of repo badges in your Readme
+ Make your problems known and ask for help!

Easy, right? Good luck!
