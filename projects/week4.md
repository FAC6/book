# Week 4 Project

## Nodecomplete

The idea is that you will create an app that uses a dictionary API to get the definition for a word as it is typed - cool, right? Oh, and it also has to be done TDD!

### Note

We recommend using the Wordnik API, as it returns the data in a much easier to manage object, leaving you time to do other cool stuff!

Make sure you spend 2/3 hours planning the project before getting started. We want to see all the planning incorporated into the README. Show us wireframes/photos/etc...

**Hint** for autocomplete you will all need a .txt file that contains all the words in the dictionary. here it is…. (link)

### Don't Forget / Minimum Features

- Project must have a What Why How Readme.
- Project must have autocomplete feature.
- Project must have hidden env vars.
- This project must be done TDD
- Repo badges :smile:
- Project must have 90% Test Coverage
- Project must be deployed to Heroku

### Strech Goals

- Try incorporating another API into your project, maybe Twitter/Facebook
- Have a look at Simple Writer for inspiration - it checks if your typed word is one of the 1,000 most common words in the English language
- Also have a look at one of FAC6’s project for this week for inspiration. :smile:
