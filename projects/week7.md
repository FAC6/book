# Week 7 project

## A Project Management app

This week, we are going to use GitHub to build an application to help us manage our workload.

If you like, take a look at tools like:
+ [HuBoard](https://huboard.com/)
+ [Waffle](https://waffle.io/)
+ [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.io/)
+ [CodeCrystal](https://codecrystal.herokuapp.com/)

We are going to spend the rest of today coming up with ideas and deciding on the application. Then we will break the task up into separate parts; design it; wireframe it; and do a README.

The aim is to have a working application by the end of the week that we can all use.
