# Learning Outcomes


## Node Core
-  Investigate the 'http' core module and its methods
- Investigate EventsEmitters
- How does module.exports work? Look at the npm docs
  - Once the Readme is complete, create one or more *tutorials** which highlight one or more of these topics.

## Node Request
- What are some of the useful properties of the request object? [method, body, url, status code]
  - Once the Readme is complete, create a simple server **tutorial** that creates a http.request to receive some form of data. (anything from simple html to api data)


## Node Stream
- What are streams (createReadStream) and what would you use them for?
    - Once the Readme is complete, create one or more *tutorials** which highlight one or more of these topics.
    - For **example** you could create a simple server tutorial that converts a csv file into a txt file and moves it from the root folder of this tutorial to a folder called `text`

## Pre-commit Hook
- What is it, why do you need it and how do you set it up? **[learn-pre-commit](https://github.com/docdis/learn-pre-commit)**
  - Once the Readme is complete, create a **Tutorial** to setup pre-commit hooks
    - Linter/syntax pre-commit hook
    - another one of your choice. :smile:


## Server Side testing
- What is server side testing?
- How does npm module tape work?
- What other kind of tests would you want to write for Node?
- What is nodemon?
  - Once the Readme is complete, create a simple server **tutorial** that uses tape for tests

## Test Coverage
- What is Istanbul?
- What is CodeCov?
- What is the difference between Istanbul & CodeCov?
  - Once the Readme is complete, create a **tutorial** that sets up Istanbul and Codecove on a simple node server.
