# Course Prerequisites

## Complete Beginners
If you are completely new to coding, run through these Codecademy tracks first (in this order).

* [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
* [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website)
* [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
* [YouTube API](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube)
* [Regex](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1)
* [Recursion](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1)

We are not looking for a row of 100% completed tracks, if you have studied this before you can skip sections but you will need to understand the full content above.

After those tracks, run through [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) (we love this!), to reinforce CSS selectors.

## Codewars
We want you to reach at least 4kyu on [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/). This is going to take a minimum of 4 weeks and more likely a few months depending on how much time you can spend working on it.

It takes a while to get the hang of Codewars (it's quite different to and a jump up from Codecademy). We've written our own guide to Codecademy and Codewars [here](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/learning-with-codewars-and-codecademy), which will help you on your way.

## Further

Anthony Alicea has two great courses on Udemy. These courses are paid but we will provide access to them for every student that asks.
 * [Javascript the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/)
 * [Learn and Understand Node](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/)

You might feel like you need more preparation. If so, take a look at chapters 1-4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf). It's helpful for understanding functions and their uses in Javascript and builds nicely on where Codecademy ends.

Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, so we'll brief on the techniques for asking questions when you arrive. Come join our Gitter channel where we chat about Codewars, Codecademy and other learning resources.

It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free).
